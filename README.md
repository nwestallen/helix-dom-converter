# HTML to helix.dom
Inspired by [similar pages](https://html2hiccup.dev/) that convert html to hiccup, this converts html to [helix's](https://github.com/lilactown/helix) dom syntax. 
I copied and modified code from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/lilactown/8e42650bcc1b45736bc52f9fdfe82dfe) by [lilactown](https://github.com/lilactown) that does the heavy lifiting and added a simple helix/react-based ui

## Quick Start
1. Clone this template into your local
2. Cd into sht-template directory and run `npm i` in your terminal
3. In the same directory run `shadow-cljs watch app` (or start via CIDER)
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view dev server
5. Make changes to src/main/app/core.cljs and save to view results
